Description: # Abuse: World's First Profanity Library
        
        
        **Behold, the power of Abuse v1.**
        
        **Abuse** allows you to use profanity when you need it, without the need for getting angry. There's no need to manually search curse words from **Google**, or to ask anybody. Abuse is 100% automatic, thanks to Python.
        
        Besides, all the cool kids are doing it. You should try it!
        
        - Let's import the beast :
        
        ```
        >>>import abuse as ab
        >>>ab.ListAbusesFrom("a")
        
        ['...', '...', '...'] #gives a list of abuses starting with the letter 'a'
        ```
        
        # Feature Support
        
        > Abuse is in it's beta.
        
        - `ListAbusesFrom()` : Returns list of abuses starting from a specific letter.
        - `RandomAbuseFrom()` : Returns a random abuse starting from a specific letter.
        - `ListAnyAbuse()` : Returns any random abuse from it's built-in dataset.
        - `ListAllAbuses()` : Returns list of abuses in it's database.
        
        
        _Abuse officially supports Python 3.4 to 3.7, but can also run on Python 2._
